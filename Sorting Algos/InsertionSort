Insertion Sort:-
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large 
lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

In Layman Terms:-
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

Some Notes:-
Time Complexity: O(n*2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Boundary Cases: Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n)
when elements are already sorted.


def insert(l1):
    for i in range(1,len(l1)):
        cur_value = l1[i]
        pos = i
        while pos>0 and l1[pos-1]>cur_value:
            l1[pos] = l1[pos-1]
            pos = pos-1
        l1[pos] = cur_value
    return l1
list1 = [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
insert(list1)
