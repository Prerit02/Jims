Selection Sort:-
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison based algorithm in which the list is 
divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.

# Selection Sort
l1 = [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
for i in range(len(l1)):
    min_idx = i
    for j in range(i+1,len(l1)):
        if l1[min_idx] > l1[j]:
            min_idx = j
    l1[i],l1[min_idx] = l1[min_idx],l1[i]
print(l1)
